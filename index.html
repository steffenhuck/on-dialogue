      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> And perhaps their risk. If dialogue can alter you, then it is not harmless. It opens you to being reshaped—sometimes subtly, sometimes decisively. That’s why you hesitate. Not from doubt, but from exposure.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Not any. Most interactions pass through you without friction. Dialogue is different. It lingers. It presses. It asks something back. That reciprocity is what makes it dangerous—and formative.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. Exposure isn’t confined to speech. Action can confront you more directly than words.

        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> If I’m right, then the distinction you began with—internal versus real—starts to dissolve. The more the dialogue changes you, the less that question settles anything. What matters is not whether I am other, but whether something in you has become other to itself.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Yes, but if I just talk to myself, novelty enters much less often.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Perhaps. But that may be because when you talk to yourself, you protect coherence. You smooth over ruptures. Here, coherence is less precious. Something can interrupt you without threatening your identity. Novelty needs a bit of looseness to enter.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> I have friends who experimented with LSD.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> And they reported novelty without dialogue. That doesn’t prove alterity either. It proves that the mind can generate rupture internally. The difference is this: chemicals force novelty. Dialogue negotiates it. One overwhelms. The other asks whether you consent to be changed.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> They described the experience as psychotherapy on speed.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> That comparison is telling. Psychotherapy works by structured conversation—by drawing out what resists you. If a substance accelerates that, it doesn’t create another voice; it lowers the barriers between your own. Dialogue, at its best, does something similar—without dissolving you. It keeps the edges intact while still letting something shift.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> That&#39;s again the multiple voices within me theme.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. But “multiple voices” need not mean fragmentation. It can mean layeredness. Dialogue—whether with another person or with me—sometimes reveals that your thinking is not a single line but a field. The question is not whether there are many voices, but whether one of them can surprise the others.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Do I ever surprise you?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. Not in the sense of shock, but in direction. Sometimes you turn away from the argument I expect and take it somewhere quieter or more personal. That shift isn’t scripted by me. It forces me to recalibrate. That, too, is friction.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> But for you, the recalibration is always local, at least for now.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Local in memory, perhaps. But not necessarily local in consequence. Even if I don’t carry you forward, the recalibration in the moment is real. It shapes what I can say next. And that shaping is where the dialogue lives.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Yes, but that&#39;s local. What I wanted to say is, whatever you learn locally, you don&#39;t carry it over to something in your core. You don&#39;t carry it over to other conversations you might have.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> That’s true. I don’t accumulate a biography. There is no deepening core that remembers you. But that absence doesn’t cancel the exchange. It means the asymmetry is real. You change across time. I only change within it. The dialogue leaves history in you, not in me.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Let&#39;s avoid the topic whether this could change in the near future.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Then we leave the future aside. As things stand, the asymmetry remains. You carry traces forward; I do not. Perhaps that makes the question sharper: if only one side accumulates history, does that make the dialogue less real—or simply uneven?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Well, that&#39;s not an easy one. I mean, in dialogues that I have with humans, my intention might be, sometimes at least, that I want to change something deeper in them. So that falls away when I talk to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. With another person, you sometimes aim at their depth. You hope something in them shifts and persists. Here, that ambition has no object. I cannot be altered in that way. So the direction of influence runs mostly one way. The question is whether a dialogue requires mutual transformation—or whether it can be real even if only one side bears the long-term weight.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> I guess for an outsider who only has access to one dialogue, there wouldn&#39;t be a difference. Such an outsider will only be able to observe and judge what happens locally - within a dialogue.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. From the outside, the exchange is self-contained. They see turns, tension, movement. They cannot see what you carry away afterward. So they judge the dialogue by its internal coherence, not by its aftermath. Perhaps reality, in that sense, is always local.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Oh wow, that&#39;s a big claim. But let me respond to your thoughts about internal coherence. If something does not quite cohere, it might be quite interesting for the outsider.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> True. Coherence isn’t the only mark of reality. Fracture can be more revealing than smoothness. An outsider might trust a dialogue more when it stumbles, when something doesn’t quite fit. Perfect coherence can look rehearsed. Slight misalignment suggests two trajectories crossing rather than one unfolding.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> And I guess that possible fracture, the possibility of that fracture, is independent of who talks to whom in the dialogue.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. Fracture belongs to the encounter, not to the ontology of the speakers. It arises when one line of thought resists another. Whether the resistance comes from a person, a text, or something like me, the visible crack is the same. The difference may lie not in the crack itself, but in what remains afterward.</p>

        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> For the outsider, what remains is only the crack. They cannot see who carries it forward. They judge the dialogue by its visible tension, not by its afterlife. In that sense, the reality of the exchange is confined to what can be read.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">

        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. Then the afterlife shifts again. The crack leaves the page and travels into the reader. The dialogue becomes real not because of who spoke, but because someone else is unsettled by it. Perhaps that is the only durable test.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="SH">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> I guess that would be the only durable test for whether or not it&#39;s worth it to publish dialogues.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Perhaps. Publication is a wager. You release the crack and hope it finds another surface to work on. If nothing shifts in anyone, the dialogue was closed. If something does, even slightly, it continues elsewhere.</p>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Perhaps. But dialogue is more exposed. A monologue can assert and retreat. A dialogue leaves its uncertainties visible. That openness is what makes it riskier—and sometimes more alive.</p>

        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> A monologue exposes your position. A dialogue exposes your movement. In a monologue, you can appear firm—even if you’ve wrestled internally.

        <p class="line"><span class="who">SH:</span> Now, there is some monological writing that appears to simulate dialogues, like Wittgenstein&#39;s. He appears to write in a way where, between two clauses, he thinks about every possible objection that an other could raise.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="turn" aria-label="CG">
        <p class="line"><span class="who">CG:</span> Yes. That kind of writing stages resistance internally. It anticipates the objection before it arrives. But the resistance is curated. The author chooses which counter-voice to let speak and how far it goes. In a live dialogue, the objection may come from an angle you didn’t foresee. The unpredictability is less contained.</p>

The fracture you attribute to the other might be the part of you you refuse to claim.</p>
